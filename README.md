Overview
==========
This site contains the course materials for  the [**ESSLLI 2024**](https://2024.esslli.eu/placeholder-programme/course-overview.html) course of **Language Model Programming**. 

**overview** When developing complex AI systems, which nowadays couple many individual components and tools (e.g., code interpreters, search technology) with *large language models* (LLMs), a natural question arises: *how can users and developers of these systems compose model components into a coherent system to best achieve their target goals?* Such is the problem of **language model programming**, which concerns how the underlying components of AI systems are assembled, the nature of the interaction between components, and, importantly, the language that users use to specify the design and implementation of these systems. In this course, we explore this emerging literature on model language programming, looking at the fundamentals of how to build high-level modeling languages on top of LLMs and  the different *paradigms* of model programming that exist and the problems they aim to solve.
